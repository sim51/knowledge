Connecting application to Neo4j via ODBC
:toc:

== Summarry

A lot of application have a connector for ODBC database (and not JDBC) like Excel, tableau, etc. 
The goal of this documentation is to help you to install an ODBC/JDBC brige for Neo4j.
 
== Market solutions

There are two market solutions to make an ODBC-JDBC bridge :

  * http://www.easysoft.com/[Easysoft] with their http://www.easysoft.com/products/data_access/odbc_jdbc_gateway/index.html[ODBC-JDBC Gateway]
  * http://uda.openlinksw.com/[Openlink] with thier http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-jdbc-st/[Single/Multi Tier ODBC-JDBC bridge]

In this documentation, we will only talk about easysoft.
